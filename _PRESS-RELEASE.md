There is an approach called "working backwards" that is widely used at Amazon. They work backwards from the customer, rather than starting with an idea for a product and trying to bolt customers onto it. While working backwards can be applied to any specific product decision, using this approach is especially important when developing new products or features.

For new initiatives a product manager typically starts by writing an internal press release announcing the finished product. The target audience for the press release is the new/updated product's customers, which can be retail customers or internal users of a tool or technology. Internal press releases are centered around the customer problem, how current solutions (internal or external) fail, and how the new product will blow away existing solutions.

If the benefits listed don't sound very interesting or exciting to customers, then perhaps they're not (and shouldn't be built). Instead, the product manager should keep iterating on the press release until they've come up with benefits that actually sound like benefits. Iterating on a press release is a lot less expensive than iterating on the product itself (and quicker!).

If the press release is more than a page and a half, it is probably too long. Keep it simple. 3-4 sentences for most paragraphs. Cut out the fat. Don't make it into a spec. You can accompany the press release with a FAQ that answers all of the other business or execution questions so the press release can stay focused on what the customer gets. My rule of thumb is that if the press release is hard to write, then the product is probably going to suck. Keep working at it until the outline for each paragraph flows. 

Oh, and I also like to write press-releases in what I call "Oprah-speak" for mainstream consumer products. Imagine you're sitting on Oprah's couch and have just explained the product to her, and then you listen as she explains it to her audience. That's "Oprah-speak", not "Geek-speak".

Once the project moves into development, the press release can be used as a touchstone; a guiding light. The product team can ask themselves, "Are we building what is in the press release?" If they find they're spending time building things that aren't in the press release (overbuilding), they need to ask themselves why. This keeps product development focused on achieving the customer benefits and not building extraneous stuff that takes longer to build, takes resources to maintain, and doesn't provide real customer benefit (at least not enough to warrant inclusion in the press release).

## Heading ##
  > Name the product in a way the reader (i.e. your target customers) will understand.
  Startupmash - learn everything about a startup before you interview.

## Sub-Heading ##
  > Describe who the market for the product is and what benefit they get. One sentence only underneath the title.
  Startupmash is for startup job hunters who are looking to obtain or crush an interview with a startup.

## Summary ##
  > Give a summary of the product and the benefit. Assume the reader will not read anything else so make this paragraph good.
  Startupmash helps you learn the names, faces, and backgrounds of the founders, the existing team, and the investors of any startup to make you look like a kick-ass applicant with a ton of interest in the company. This knowledge will be tremendously valuable as you speak to folks within the startup, as you'll have the wherewithall to talk company details and seem genuinely excited about the company.  The details picked up from startupmash could be the difference-maker in landing your dream job.

## Problem ##
  > Describe the problem your product solves.
  Managing details and facts about all of the startups you apply to can be quite difficult. Unfortunately, appearing knowlegable about the company details can be extremely important for fluid interview conversation and to demonstrate genuine interest in the company.  Currently, there's no way to quickly and learn the details about a company in an intuitive and fun way just before an interview or phone call.

## Solution ##
  > Describe how your product elegantly solves the problem.
  Startupmash provides a fun and intuitive gamification to learning the names, faces, and details about a startup you are applying to.  Using round-based tests based on pictures and company information, users can complete quizzes to help memorize facts that will land them there next job!

## How to Get Started ##
  > Describe how easy it is to get started.
  Startupmash is dead simple. Just show up to our site, type in a company, and answer the round by round questions to practice the details.

## Customer Quote ##
  > Provide a quote from a hypothetical customer that describes how they experienced the benefit.
  "I had three full-stack interviews this week, and I showed up to each one more knowlegable about the company than my interviewer! With so much content to discuss and such a strong appearance of interest in each company, the offers started rolling in!"

## Closing and Call to Action ##
